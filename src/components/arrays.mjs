We were not allowed to use frameworks in this project, even though i had learned tailwind. But because of tailwind i had learned a lot about reusing your styling. So my code is really nice and neat! Our goal in this exam was to use API to POST, PUT, DELETE or GET information. This, for me, was really nice, i love that it made everything so much easier. This was also a big learning curve, since we had not used API for more than a GET call. So learning how to send information to the API as well, was really helpful! ",

In this Project my code is also much cleaner, which really shows how far you can get on a short time span. ",
